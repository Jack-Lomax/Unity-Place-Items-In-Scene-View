# Unity-Place-Items-In-Scene-View
This is a little asset that I made that allows you to place GameObjects in the unity scene view

Made by Jack-Lomax @ Wildflare

Steps To Add

1. Put the PlacementTool.cs Script in a folder named "Editor" (Imperitive)

2. Add an empty GameObject and apply the Placement Setup Script.

3. While script is active in the hierarchy, your selected options will be active.

Options

1. AddPrefab will allow you to spawn prefabs with left-mouse

2. RemovePrefab will allow you to remove prefabs with left-mouse

3. RemoveAllPrefabs will allow you to remove all prefabs
